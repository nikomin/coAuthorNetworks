Script to generate co-author networkship from bibtex file using python (so far doesn't work with python3).

The script uses [bibtexparser](https://github.com/sciunto-org/python-bibtexparser)
Quick install with pip:
```bash
pip2 install bibtexparser #or use --user if you don't have the root writing right
```


To use the script:
```bash
python2 main.py >  edgelistNames.csv
```
